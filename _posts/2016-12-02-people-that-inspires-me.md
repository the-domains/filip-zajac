# People that inspires me

[Bret Victor][0] because of his inovative approach to product design.

[Bill Buxton][1] explans me the sense what the heck experience design is.

[Mahatma Gandhi][2] represents the values I want to be.

[Gendun Rinpoche][3] placed the joy of everyday stuffs on the top of all.
