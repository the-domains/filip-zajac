# Beyond the UI design -- case study

Designing user interface visual are on the contrary of designing experience often matter of designers feelings and brand guides. But what if we take step back to revise UI design process in the same manner as UX does?

Last challenge at Kentico software was to set up new visual of the Kentico Cloud. Thanks to the company's generosity to let employees take an extra mile to experiment and research non-standard opportunities, I have taken the experiment of the UI design method.

## Why we gave a shit to new UI

Kentico Cloud leverages material design to quickly build the basic product. However, it generated two side effect. The product is using the visual language of Google and beside the myriad of other products using material design, the appearance of the was too generic which leads to lower trust. The company's vision is to become domain thought leader and with the generic product appearance, this becomes a serious problem.

It wasn't the first project for me neither for the company has redesigned its previous product couple years ago. Matej Kvasnovsky has written the blog post about it.

Inspired by Matej's work with insights of Kristy (a fellow designer at Intercom) and fascination of Roland Barthes book Mythologies, I put together an outline of the project.

* **Reseach phase**In research phase I wanted to accumulate data for the creative phase.
* **Creative phase**Goal is was ideate visual material from researched data and its constraints for delivering phase.
* **Delivering phase**To produce deliverables from ideated visuals for implementation.

## Research phase

### Step one -- research a question

To set up the research is always a never-ending dilemma. To conduct any research we need a question so we can get the answer. But we also need a good question. So we need to question a question. Damn

**Helpful mental exercise**  
I knew what needs to be delivered. Right? But I don't know how it should look like. So I need to set up some criteria that help me evaluate the results. Bingo. Here we go.

**Criteria for the project**

* Unique visual language or at least distinguishable from notoriously known tech brands like Google, Microsoft, Apple, Dropbox etc.
* Original visual language that represents company's values.
* Meaningful visual language that supports the productivity of product users.

**Constraints**Kentico has already developed branding and the new product visual must respect the mother brand, on the other side it needs to be distinguishable enough from other company's product.

### Step two -- get evaluation criteria

This is the part that most of the visual project is missing because the evaluation visual quality is hard to measure. However, the clever people have done the evaluation methods for us. Since the visual is a matter of appeal we will evaluate the quality though the adjectives that represent it.

Here we set up the bunch of adjectives, which was carefully discussed and derived from the project request and the company values. Those can be used by any of the described methods -- semantic differential or desirability test.

### Step three -- get inspired

This is the part where everybody looks how it was done previously. However, from my point of view, it is completely wrong if your aim is to create something original. Original in terms of including a touch of an original source.
