As a designer, I have been designing tools for digital marketers at [Kentico][0], a product for controlling energy usage at [Energomonitor ][1]and social network to rise gift economy at [Hearth.net][2].

One of my dreams is to change the way how type designers create fonts by developing the tools for them --- [Letterink.][3]

With my friends, we have been running local design coworking office in Brno --- [CWRK][4]
